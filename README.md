# Welcome to My Portfolio
### In this portfolio there are 3 sections. The about me section, the portfolio display, and the contact me section. It was smacked together in 3.5 seconds using bootstrap components. If you would like to use it for your portfolio go ahead. It's perfect for students... probably.

### Here's a screenshot of the site if you want to use it:
